        "Welcome to my second React application. This website is dedicated to software engineering, my passion for software engineering, and to my learning journey. My name is Dan Wiener and I am a software engineer; a passionate software engineer. I love making software solutions of all kinds, but one of the most exhilarating feelings is pushing the boundaries of my skills and learning a new technology. I also love that feeling when I've been immersing myself in deep problem solving for a while and come up with a good solution to solve a complex problem in code. The feeling of accomplishment I get from that is unrivaled, and it is an understatement to say I take a great amount of pride in my work."
        // I am particularly fond of modern frameworks and modern technologies, but I love the opportunity to solve any
        // kind of software problem, the larger, more important, and more complex, the better. I often waiver between
        // unwaivering confidence and debilitating impostor syndrome depending on the day or the hour, but my commitment to getting better
        // has never stopped, and I have a natural want-to-learn-it-all and I-want-to-be-the-best attitude which drives me forward and to surround myself with mentors and people
        // better than myself whom I learn from, whom push me to be better, but also sadly whom I compare myself to
        // and then feel profoundly sad. Such is the life of a programmer? I want to contribute something meaningful. I just
        // want to contribute something meaningful; that's all. I find all facets of programming fascinating,
        // but areas which particularly intrigue me are optimization and multithreading, which I deep dove into while
        // attending the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy when I was able to drastically reduce runtime
        // utilizing .NET tasks and multithreading techniques. This learning also helped me identify and solve a race condition on the job
        // at my first software engineering role, which I was very proud of, and the knowledge of data structures and algorithms
        // I gained from my relentless practice and endless nights solving algorithms has helped me optimize code for
        // runtime improvements of up to 97%. That said, I am not perfect, and there are several facets of software engineering
        // which I seek to improve in; these include clean code, the importance of which I have learned through experience on the job
        // and dealing with other people's code. I have also long had an interest in web development and particularly modern 
        // js frameworks such as React or languages such as TypeScript, so I'm currently seeking to improve my skills in this realm,
        // but I also greatly enjoy .NET and C#. I want to become more well-rounded in every regard, and in preparation for a new possible opportunity,
        // I have been studying cloud (ramping up my skills in AWS), as well as Java SpringBoot. I am currently
        // building a project which includes Java SpringBoot and React which is this website, to demonstrate my learning
        // and gain hands-on experience. Other categories which fascinate me are both front end and backend,
        // as I love developing client-facing code and developing UI, and its associated callbacks, while I also greatly enjoy
        // backend and developing APIs, etc. a love for which I fostered while building my own authentication protocol which mimics
        // OAUTH during the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy. I just love making software that makes an impact on someone.
        // Anyway, I could wax poetic all night, but I am running out of things to say. I am just a developer who loves code,
        // who wants to support my family, and wants to constantly improve. I would love to work with you to take on a new challenge and
        // support your business with my fierce dedication to being better and providing the best product possible. The satisfaction I feel from making
        // someone the customer directly benefits from, that I poured heart and soul into, is unwaivering. For the last year, I have been working as a
        // software engineer as a subcontractor for a large space/defense organization, which has given me experience working within the strict confines
        // of a regimented set of legacy frameworks and tightly-guarded development practices. Anyway, one last thing about me:
        // I come from a family of software engineers, but I don't live in their shadow. I try not to. At least. I am my own software engineer.
        // That's why I didn't do softare engineering for so long. Because the bar they set was so high. They are so successful. There was just no
        // way I could ever attain their level of success. Dad who was a PHD/professor of software engineering at a major university. Half brothers who are 
        // successful developers in the Bay Area (that is an understatement - but I won't go into further detail). Engineers left and right and on both sides
        // of the family, mother who is a software engineer, etc. It wasn't until I was 27-28, then, that I picked up an interest in software engineering
        // and decided to learn it in my free time, when I instantly fell in love and realized my passion and what I have been missing this whole time. I see
        // why people love software engineering. I love software engineering, and think with time I will be well-equipped for it, but for now, I'm
        // just trying to be as good as I can be. As good as my brothers, which I won't ever be. P.S. I love you :) Thanks for reading my website!
        // This site will detail my learning journey and sort of document learning artifacts I find, have found useful, or have used to bolster my knowledge
        // and increase my competence as a software engineer. I hope you can gain value from this site as I gained value from these resources!"
